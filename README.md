## **Testing**

•	On smaller screen sizes the logo is located at the top of the navigation bar.
•	I checked that the page is responsive, works and looks good on the standard screen sizes (ipad, MotoG4, iphone6/7/8, iphone5/SE and Galaxy S5) using the devtools device toolbar.
•	I have checked that the above mentioned features work as expected, the form requires entry on each field, the email field accepts only email address and the checkbox requires that the user checks it before submission, and the submit button allows the user to submit feedback.
